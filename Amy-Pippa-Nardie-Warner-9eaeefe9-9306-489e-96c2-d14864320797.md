### About

I discovered UX Design by chance after seeing my brother struggle to use technology designed to help him. After exploring the design process, I decided to change my career and apply my research background to bolster design solutions that affect individuals. I aim to be a designer that empathizes with others and balances aestheticism with research insights as a means to engender inclusivity and awareness.
